# Hi there, I'm John!

Welcome to my official GitHub profile. This space serves as the central hub for my professional and personal work, showcasing my journey through software development and my commitment to the open-source community.

### About My Work
I am a developer focused on creating efficient, scalable, and user-friendly applications. My goal is to build tools that solve real-world problems while maintaining clean and maintainable codebases. All my significant open-source contributions and personal projects are hosted right here for everyone to explore and use.

### Technical Proficiency
- **Next.js & React:** I have a solid foundation in Next.js, utilizing it to build high-performance web applications with a focus on great user experience and modern architecture.
- **Python:** I am proficient in Python, using it primarily for backend development, automation scripts, and exploring data-driven solutions.
- **Continuous Learning:** I am always experimenting with new libraries and frameworks to stay up-to-date with the ever-evolving tech landscape.

### Beyond the Code: xpot.ch
I maintain a personal website at **[xpot.ch](https://xpot.ch)** which acts as an extension of my GitHub profile. It’s a place where I share more than just code:
- **Blog & Venting:** I use my site as a personal outlet to share my thoughts, write articles, and "vent" about various topics. It’s a space for my unfiltered opinions and reflections.
- **Status Page:** You can find real-time updates and the current status of the services and projects I’m running.
- **Personal Updates:** A place for everything else that doesn't necessarily fit into a code repository but is part of my digital life.

### Contact & Connectivity
Communication is key for collaboration. If you'd like to reach out regarding a project, a bug report, or a potential partnership, please use the following channels:

- **Discord (Most Active):** `chaoticpotato69` — This is by far the fastest way to get a response from me.
- **Email:** `john@xpot.ch` — For more formal inquiries or detailed messages.
- **Reddit:** [u/chaoticpotato69](https://www.reddit.com/user/chaoticpotato69)

### Social Media Policy
- **X (Twitter):** I maintain an account on X, but please note that I use it exclusively for browsing and staying informed. I do not post content or check direct messages there.
- **Other Platforms:** I value my focus and privacy; therefore, I do not use any other social media platforms. Any other accounts claiming to be me on other sites are unofficial.
